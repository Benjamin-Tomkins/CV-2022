#### <a name="About"></a>About :

`Senior full stack GitOps designer/developer` and `certified Integration Architect` — with a background in both software/hardware development, covering: making, inventing, designing, patenting, and prototyping cool stuff you can touch, click, and depend on; using tools like `Visual Studio Code`, `Git`, `Postman`, `Docker`, `Matlab`, `Simulink`. and `TensorFlow`.

#### <a name="SOA"></a>Service-Oriented Architecture ( design / prototyping ) :

+ `Self-aligning wound healing plasters` __ efficiently reducing caesarean section scars without surgery **[in-dev]
+ `Proof of concept for a tiered compiler` __ representing software in matrix form, to be algebraically simplified before optimising with a language compiler.
+ `Integrated database numerical engine` __ enabling computation on medical data without violating patient confidentiality.
+ `Ai Cancer detection system` __ analysing voxel-based data for CT scanners to determine likelihood and specialist recommendation engine.
+ `Ai system for SLR lenses` __ predictive algorithm to boost the quality of glass lenses to be closer to that of gemstone lenses.
+ `Representing numbers in cool new ways` __ buy me a drink and I'll draw you a picture.
+ `Cool plant/aeroponics stuff` __ buy me a drink and I'll still not tell you #NDA

#### <a name="APPS"></a>Application Development :
+ Completed Udemy courses on: Docker, DevOps (CI/CD), XPath locators for Selenium, Automation Testing Selenium & Nightwatch, Git Command-Line Mastery, jQuery, and becoming a Certified SolidWorks Associate (CSWA).
+ <a href="https://reactjs.academy/">ReactJS Academy</a> intensive week bootcamp: ReactJS, Redux, TDD, GraphQL, Styled-Components, SSR
+ <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Graduate</a>: JS/ES6, Ruby, TDD, Java, Node, ReactJS, and SpringBoot for the last 3 months
+ Done some Matlab, Python (sooo rusty), Adobe products, Visual Paradigm, all things JetBrains, Solidworks, MapleSoft (google it), and the usual bits.
+ Went to school and studied <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/degree.jpg">BSc Design Futures</a> at Westminster University.
+ Am Solidworks <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/solidworks.png">Certified</a>.
+ Took the Stanford Professional <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/stanford.jpg">High Performance Websites</a> course __ taught by <a href="https://stevesouders.com/about.php">Steve Souders</a>.
+ Aced <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/big_data.png">MIT’s Big Data</a> course.
+ Did one of those online courses from Brown University, in <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/linear_algebra.png">Applied Linear Algebra in Python</a>.
+ And, am also experienced in prototyping, manufacturing (virtual and physical), and 3D printing (stereolithography).
